# Randle Recipes Concept

My Cousin and I colaborated to build an online recipe book for our relatives can use to see what we cook and upload their own recipes.

The app was built using MERN stack with using a GraphQL API. I built the backend and my cousin built the frontend.

We also implemented user accounts with our own JWT auth system and role permissions, with the admin role having the ability to update other users details.

My Dad then comissioned someone to transcribe hundreds of old family recipes from my grandmother cookbook so that they could be uploaded and shared with the whole family anywhere in the world.

# The build

## Stack

The app is built using **MERN** stack. **M**ongoDB for the Database, **E**xpressJS for the webserver/http-handler, **R**eactJS as our component framework, **N**odeJS for the JavaScript runtime.

We chose this stack because of its simplicity, familiarity, popularity, and ease of deployment. It also presented us with a chance to try out some interesting and complex features without being bagged down by learning an unfamiliar stack.

Due to the highly connected nature of our data and objects, I opted to go for a GraphQL API which I had fun building and learned a lot.
